This ROS workspace was built for a turtlebot to autonomously navigate through UTIAS.

Steps:
1. Network Configuration
	a. Copy turtlebot_autonomy workspace into turtlebot home
	b. turtlebot: cd turtlebot_autonomy && catkin_make
	d. Connect workstation to Turtlebot wifi network
	e. "ifconfig" to determine ip addresses
	f. Add the following into turtlebot's .bashrc file
		export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.42.0.1:11311
		export ROS_HOSTNAME=10.42.0.1
		source ~/turtlebot_autonomy/devel/setup.bash
	g. Close turtlebot netbook
	h. Add the following into the workstation's .bashrc file
		export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.42.0.1:11311
		export ROS_HOSTNAME=IP_OF_WORKSTATION
	   (turtlebot_autonomy should already be sourced)
	i. workstation (3 terminals): ssh turtlebot@10.42.0.1 --admin password for turtlebot is "turtlebot"

2. Bringup
	a. Press power button on kobuki base, ensure USB cables are connected properly to netbook
 	b. turtlebot: roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch --turtlebot will chirp happily
	   turtlebot check: rosnode list
	   workstation check: rostopic list
        c. turtlebot: roslaunch kobuki_auto_docking minimal.launch
	d. workstation: rqt -s kobuki_dashboard --should be able to see battery status on message board with no warnings

3. Teleop
	a. workstation ready: roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
          or workstation: roslaunch turtlebot_teleop xbox360_teleop.launch
	b. Use teleop when it is necessary to override commands from algorithms
		i.e. running this command stops turtlebot if in autonomous routine

6. Autonomous Navigation
	a. Ensure that parameter and launchfile for amcl on turtlebot package is correct
	a. turtlebot: roslaunch turtlebot_2dnav amcl.launch
	c. workstation: roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch
	d. Use workstation rviz to set navigation goals to turtlebot
	or workstation: rosrun simple_navigation_goals utias_navigation_goals.py

Appendix A: Mapping
1. Gmapping
	a. turtlebot: roslaunch turtlebot_2dnav gmapping.launch
	b. workstation: cd bagfiles && rosbag record -O BAGFILE /odom /scan /tf
	c. turtlebot: cd turtlebot_autonomy/src/turtlebot_2dnav/maps && rosrun map_server map_saver -f MAP_NAME
